Each input field takes a user input and updates the table in html upon exiting focus on the field, either by pressing Tab, Enter, or clicking out of the field.</br>
The table update works in reverse for each field as well, when deleting the contents of an input field, it is removing the filter applied. </br>
I have also added a button at the bottom of the filter section to remove all filters at once for easier use.
